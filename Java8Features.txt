Java 8 Features 

1. Lambda Expression 
2. Functional Interface 
3.Default Method 
4.Static Method in interface 
5. Predicate -- predefine FI
6. Function  --predefine FI
7.Consumer --- predefine FI
8. :: Method Refernce & Consturctor refernce 
9. Stream API -- to write more concise code 
10. Date and Time API (JODA API )


Why we need 1.8 -
1. to simplify programming
2. to utilize functional programming benefit in java
3. to enable parallel processing 

1. Advantage Lambda Expression-
================================
To enable functional programming in java 
To write more readable , maintainable & concise code 
To use API's very easily and effetively 
To enable Parallel processing 

from lambda expression we can access class label variable 
from lambda expression we can access local variable but local variable which are refernced with lambda expression is final , within lambda expression or outside lambda expression
you can't change the value , if you wan to change it , it will throw class class cast exception 

 

Predicate --
==================
Predicate return type always boolean value 
interface Predicate<T>
{
boolean test(T t)
}  //it will take some input , perform operation and return boolean value .

Function--
====================
interface function< t ,r> // 2 arguments - 1 is input argument and another is return type
{
 r apply (t) 
}

whether it may be function or predicate it must return some value 

Consumer --
=============
sometime i want to give some input and perform some operation but don't want return 

interface consumer<t>
{
void accept (t)
}
Supplier---
======================
Supplier<R> - return type //
{
R get() // won't take any argument 
}
