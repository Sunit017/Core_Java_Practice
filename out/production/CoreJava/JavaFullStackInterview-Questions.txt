Questions--
1. How to handle multiple beans in springboot ? ans - 2 types - @primary and @qualifer 
2. how to create custome annotation in springboot - to define custom annotation you need to create interface and use meta annoations like @target and @retention 
3. what is caching in springboot - suppose we db , specfic query we have to hit often , then we implement caching mechanism that saves client money , using this caching 
we get data , everytime no need to hit the query , and also manages time , there are many caching mechanism like escache , redischache  , @cacheable - mark method result 
which store in cache and @cachevict - we don't need cache anymore 

4. how interservice communication happen in microservices?
ans - in 2 types synchronous and asychronous , 

5. how we can customize the auto configuration in springboot - in various way we can do it by using application properties or we can create @configuration file there
we create bean of it like suppose you don't want by default datasource we can create bean of data source in our configuration file 

6. What are the differnt scopes in springboot ?
- singleton , prototype, request , session , websocket 

7. can we create custom scope ?
ans - yes we can 

8.what is differnce between @sprigbootapplication and @enableautoconfiguration 
ans - @sprigbootapplication combination of 3 - @configuration ,@enableautconfiguration,@componentscan 	, @enableautoconfiguration is automatic configuration of 
spring bean depends on class path depedencies 

9. what is differnce between service registry and service discovery ?

ans - 

10. what is saga design pattern in microservices?
ans - The Saga Design Pattern is a distributed transaction management pattern used in microservices architectures to maintain 
data consistency across multiple services without relying on traditional ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions

11. What is the differnce between factory and abstract factory design pattern ?
ans - both come from creational design pattern (Trying to create complex object), factory design - 	


12. What is rate limiting ?
ans - limits the number of hits goes to microservices , it won't allow multiple hits and it also its prevent from that 

13 . What is springboot starter ?
ans - it is springboot library , we won't write boiler plate code , makes developer task easy like , springboot -starter -web , springboot -starter - data jpa

14. What order of precedence in SpringBoot ?
ans - commandline - enviorment variable - external file 

15 - What circular dependecy ?
ans - suppose we have service A and Service B in some situation service A depends on Service b and same time serive b is also depends on service a by directly
or indirectly and it will be in the loop call that we can call circulat dependecy

16. What is @SpringBootApplication ?
ans - it is combination of @componentscan , @springbootconfiguration , @enableautconfiguration 

17 . What is the default endpoint of springboot actuator ?
ans - /info , /actuator 

18 . Spring profile ?
ans - spring profile basically means provide differnt enviorment for differnce configuration  

19. Java Memory Management ?

20 . What is deep copy and shallow copy ?
Ans - A shallow copy copies only the reference to the objects, not the actual objects themselves
      A deep copy creates an entirely new copy of an object along with all the referenced objects

21. Where u used factory design pattern ?
ans - 

How to communicate between 2 micro services ?
Ans -Syncronus - asynchronous
rest template - feign client ,web client - reactive programming , non blocking , better choice handling high concurency application , 
message broker - rabit mq , kafka , 

What is Saga design Pattern ?
ans - The Saga Design Pattern is used in distributed systems to manage long-running transactions across multiple microservices without using distributed transactions.
 It ensures data consistency by using a sequence of local transactions across multiple services.
Types of Saga Pattern
There are two main types of Saga patterns:
1️.Choreography-Based Saga (Event-Driven)
2️.Orchestration-Based Saga (Centralized Control)

Volatile - Used to indicate variable value can be edited by differnt thread , it ensure visibility of variable , it tells jvm value of varibale may be change and get update 

Trasinet - context of serialization , any varibale as transiant that specific field not serialize .

Atomic - Varible can be read and update in single operation , 

What is class loader 
it part of jre, we have bootstrap, system class loader
