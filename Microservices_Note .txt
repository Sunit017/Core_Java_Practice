	-------------Microservice Architecture ----------
	=================================================
	
- Building small small services is called microservices 
- Indepedently deployable 
- Each application can be tested differently
- code change in one service doestn't need an entire application testing 
- Scalable and independently deployable when the load increases 
- Auto Scaling -(suppose i have one service which is getting more and more request so we can create another instance of it and deploy it into server 



Load Balancer -:
will do when the request will to server it will route the request to multiple server
